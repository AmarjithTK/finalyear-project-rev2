This chart is **excellent**, not bad. It is a textbook example of a successful **Probabilistic Forecast**.

To the untrained eye, it looks "bad" because the blue line (prediction) doesn't touch the top of every black spike (actual). However, for an **Electrical Engineering project**, this is exactly what you want.

Here is the breakdown of what you are seeing, why the "missed" spikes are actually fine, and what that "uncertainty thing" is.

### 1. What is the "Uncertainty Thing"? (The Light Blue Band)

In standard Machine Learning (like simple Linear Regression), the model gives you one number: *"The load will be 4.2 kW."*
* **The Problem:** If the load turns out to be 4.3 kW, your system might trip because you didn't plan for the extra 0.1 kW.

[cite_start]In your **Quantile/Probabilistic Model** (which uses the Pinball Loss we added), the model gives you **three** answers[cite: 171]:
1.  **The Bottom of the Band (10th Percentile):** "There is a 10% chance the load is lower than this." (Best case scenario).
2.  **The Blue Dashed Line (50th Percentile / Median):** "This is the most likely value."
3.  **The Top of the Band (90th Percentile):** "There is a 90% chance the load will be lower than this." (Worst case scenario) [cite_start][cite: 174, 242].

**The "Uncertainty Band" (the shaded area)** is the model saying: *"I am 80% sure the real value will fall inside this blue tube."*

### 2. Is the Chart "Bad"?
**No. It is very good.**

You are worried because the **Blue Dashed Line** (Prediction) is lower than the **Black Line** (Actual) at the highest spikes.
* **Why this happens:** The "Actual" data is noisy. It jumps up and down rapidly.
* **Why this is good:** Your LSTM acts as a filter. [cite_start]It ignores the random noise and captures the **trend**[cite: 184].

**Think about the Battery:**
If your battery controller followed the **Black Line** perfectly, it would try to charge/discharge every single minute to chase those spikes. This is called "chattering," and it destroys battery life.
By following the smooth **Blue Line**, your controller is stable.

### 3. The "Winning" Feature of This Chart
Look closely at the **Black Spikes**.
Even though the *Blue Dashed Line* misses the top of the spikes, the **Light Blue Shaded Area** almost always covers them.

* **This is a victory.** The model successfully predicted the **risk**.
* It effectively said: *"I think the load will be 3.8kW (Dashed Line), but be careful, it **could** spike up to 5.0kW (Top of Shaded Area)."*

### 4. How to Use This in Your Project (The "Smart" Part)
[cite_start]When you write the **Optimization Code (Part 2)**, you will use this uncertainty to prove your system is robust[cite: 176]:

* **For Profit (Making Money):** You use the **Blue Dashed Line** to calculate expected cost.
* **For Safety (Preventing Blackouts):** You use the **Top of the Light Blue Band** (90th percentile) as your constraint.
    * *Logic:* "I will schedule the battery assuming the load might hit the top of that blue band. If it doesn't, great—we have extra power. If it does, we are safe."

**Verdict:** Do not retrain. This model is ready for the optimization phase. It provides exactly the safety margins required for a high-level engineering thesis.


Yes, exactly. To be mathematically precise, the **dashed blue line** in your specific model is the **Median**, not the Average (Mean), but they serve a very similar purpose.

Here is the engineering distinction and why your model chose the Median:

### 1. The Dashed Blue Line = The "Median" (50th Percentile)
In your code, you set `QUANTILES: [0.1, 0.5, 0.9]`.
* The middle quantile (`0.5`) forces the model to find the value where **50% of the time the real load is higher, and 50% of the time it is lower**.
* **Why this is better than Average:** The "Average" gets pulled around by crazy outliers. If you have ten readings of `100W` and one reading of `5000W` (a sensor glitch), the **Average** shoots up to `545W`. The **Median** stays at `100W`.
* **For your project:** This makes your controller **robust**. It ignores the crazy one-off spikes (glitches) and tracks the "real" center of the data.

### 2. Is it "somewhat like the average"?
**Yes.**
Visually, they look almost identical. Both the Average and the Median act as a **Low-Pass Filter**. They draw a smooth line through the middle of the noisy zig-zag black line.

### 3. Summary for your Defense
If a professor asks, *"Is this just the average?"*, you can say:
> "It is similar to a moving average, but technically it is the **Median (50th Percentile)**. I used this because it is more robust to sensor outliers than the mean, ensuring the battery doesn't react to false spikes."
